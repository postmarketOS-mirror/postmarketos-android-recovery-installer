# postmarketOS Android Recovery ZIP Installer

Makes it possible to install postmarketOS via TWRP and other Android recovery
OS. Find more information [in the wiki](https://postmarketos.org/recoveryzip).

This has been created by Attila Szollosi in 2017 and was moved from
pmbootstrap.git to pmaports.git and then finally into its own repository.
